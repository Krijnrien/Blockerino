# Blockerino

Landing on a new strange plane, youâ€™re left with limited resources. Fighting for survival, digging deeper finding new resources, researching new technologies, advancing your abilities, all to seek new fortunes. Using programming you can automate computers, robots and other technologies to do your bidding. Escape gravity and explore other planets within your solar system, your options and exploration are endless!

Revolving around crafting, resource-gathering, building combat and automation, Blockerino is based on an exploration-adventure style gameplay designed for programmers of all skill levels. Having no clear purpose nor end goal the player has complete freedom in his infinite big, procedurally generated, 2D sandbox world of tiles offering endless replay value. Throwing the player back to the good old graphical style of 16-bit sprites.
